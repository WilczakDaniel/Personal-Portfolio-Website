# React Native FlatList optimization with pagination

While rendering a list of elements inside a React Native app, developer can choose two ways. Either render it inside ScrollView using `.map()` or use some help from baked in components like FlatList.

## FlatList vs ScrollView

When you need to render some small groups of static data - simple .map function inside a View or ScrollView is enough and will not cause any issues.
But! When your data can grow over-time, e.g. when it depends on some external API calls or simply it’s a list that has no specified length - FlatList is usually a better choice.  
FlatList gives you lazy loading, infinite scroll and more out of the box! Need three columns list? Simply use `numColumns` prop and you are ready to go!

```jsx
const GroceryItem: React.FC<GroceryItemProps> = ({ item }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>{item.name}</h2>
            <p>Price: {item.price}</p>
            <p>Quantity: {item.quantity}</p>
        </div>
    );
};
```
